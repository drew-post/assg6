Compiling and Running
- Open in Code::Blocks
- Build and Run 


Notes
- Changed Code::Blocks settings to compile with GCC by the C++11 standard
- If you are running the program and entering a file that was converted to ppm with GIMP, the second line with the '#' comment should be deleted before reading it in.
